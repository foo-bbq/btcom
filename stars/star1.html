            We wandered once more<br>
            Blue-Green Marble and me<br>
            Considering all Sol's sides<br>
            <br>
            In course, clamoring crows <br>
            Foip and Voip, a crapulous cloud<br>
            Feathers variably valuable <br>
            Squawking vye, feathers fly<br>
            “We for use-usury cast-facers flock.<br>
            “Feathers free given! Feast!”<br>
            Apple-ashen offer, bargain-blood<br>
            You bemusedly, “Dew drops thirst-slake?”<br>
            Wave-handingly we warned, <br>
            "Deign no deep-delving, <br>
            “Finding there dread-despair, <br>
            “Far from fortune, friend-family!<br>
            “Pluck poison-plumage, play!<br>
            You concernedly, “Feelings fell deter thee?”<br>
            Laugh-louding we, “Forewarned, forearmed, <br>
            “Oft felt-feelings fill furious fast,<br>
            “But ebullient bursting we <br>

            Indeed as indicated, which fire fight? Which blaze light? To foment or ferment, the question of Today. <br>
            Our plans are found in disarray, but disaster, delay, delight, who can say? <br>
            <br>
            Dear Change, our unexpected guest, has come<br>
            And seeing all our days so carefully arranged<br>
            Touches each without it registered<br>
            All the many ways in which a change<br>
            Sees all these days undoing premature.<br>
            We see our days devour’d in rest and toil;<br>
            Domestic maintenance which never done,<br>
            Replete, and never disregarded stays<br>
            For any length of time beyond the day!<br>
            <br>
            Cruel Change, who binds us to our task,<br>
            And though we are incumbent, asked to lay<br>
            Recumbent or procumbent every day, (your choice!)<br>
            See futures moving forward while we stay,<br>
            And wandering goes our early given voice,<br>
            Not gone, but modified - a call that heard<br>
            Echoes in our hearts and minds, but soft,<br>
            And heartless though a Change may present seem,<br>
            Lo, what present now might take a way,<br>
            Re turn to make a gift, some other day.<br>
            <br>
            No person yet can see what time will write,<br>
            No, nor prediction made which falls so far<br>
            From mark so as to disregard all words.<br>
            Words which writings form from folly fingers<br>
            Touching eyes and whisper lips we all can see<br>
            And hearing, seeing still will not agree.<br>
            <br>
            Our common course, our valued vices both<br>
            Shall bind our destinies together,<br>
            Forged blow for blow with glowing hearts and fists<br>
            Which grasp at tools of bone and sinew wrought<br>
            And beat the glowing formless shape of gods<br>
            Whose faces given look upon our own.<br>
            In unknown measures tender and severe,<br>
            Intoned from throats which claw with hunger hear,<br>
            "All shall come to pass, and so in passing<br>
            Pull gently, swiftly on to calmer waters there."<br>
            <br>
            Satisfaction? Disillusionment? Perhaps.<br>
            Look but to our alternatives presented -<br>
            <br>
            To weep, to laugh, to mourn, to scorn, to pray<br>
            To seek to understand and yet dismay,<br>
            Despair of bringing light to darkness, nay<br>
            Sight where blinded eyes see only that<br>
            Which numbing fingers yet do touch.<br>
            <br>
            Whose eyes see all? Whose right is rightest now?<br>
            A Truth, a constant seeming place to build<br>
            A sense of what is real, and so distinguish<br>
            Light from dark; a current cold or warm;<br>
            A star which navigation does depend upon <br>
            Which yet is found unfixed in space (and time!).<br>
            <br>
            So too is Truth a thing which cannot stay,<br>
            But in defining must in Change remain.<br>
            A river not a river still when still becomes. <br>
            So Changed are we, in flesh possessed by Time.<br>
            And Truth becomes us all in Time we find.<br>
            <br>
            Tears shed for plans undone are rivulets, searching from the futures where they spring, a mirror of actions
            passed which will not pass away. <br>
            Our depthless souls, riddling with trenches from murky bubbling pools of mind to bedrock of beating heart,
            polluted by these hyper-saline regrets.<br>
            They settle in our lungs choking on the ashes of bridges burned yet unbuilt.<br>
            Their freezing sorrows hiss and crackle against the heat of our fierce hearts, billowing steam, we hiss and
            burst with the pressure.<br>
            Like automatons we whir into action, driven to guard our chewy tender centers from scalding passion, numbing
            pain. <br>
